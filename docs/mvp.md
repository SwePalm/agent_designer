# MVP details

## Concept
Agent Designer is a lightweight process for turning your expectations of an AI assistant into a clear, shareable skills document.

## Flow
1. Select a behavior that matches the tone and style you want.
2. Choose the tasks the agent should focus on.
3. Add the context, constraints, and preferences it should follow.
4. Define evaluations to clarify what “good” looks like.
5. Generate `SKILLS.md` for review and iteration.

## Non-goals
- No real tool execution or automation in the MVP.
- No external system access or data ingestion.
- No long-running or multi-agent workflows yet.
